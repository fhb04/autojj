# autojj
A script that automatically performs jumping jacks in roblox.

# Requirements:
- Python 3.7+ (may work on older versions).
- **Num2words**, **Pydirectinput**, **Pynput**, and **time** modules.
- An IDE or place to run the script (I use PyCharm).
- (Recommended) A basic understanding of Python.

# How To Use:
Once you've met the requirements listed above, run the script. You will be given 5 seconds to tab into roblox. 
From there, you just need to let the script run. Unfortunately, there isn't a failsafe, and you'll have to
scramble back to the program you ran the script in to stop it.
